INTRODUCTION

1.1 Overview

A library management system is software built expressly to manage all the functions of a library. It is beneficial for the librarian to keep track of new books as well as books that members have borrowed and the dates on which they must be returned.
This solution will completely automate all the operations in your library. The most effective technique for handling, arranging, and systematically maintaining many books is to use library management system software.
A library database management system is used to keep library records organized. It keeps track of the overall quantity of books in the library, how many books are checked out, how many books are returned, renewed, or charged late penalties, and so on.
You will be able to identify books in seconds, issue, and reissue books quickly, and manage all data in an efficient and orderly manner with this system. The major goal of a library management system is to make it easier to provide accurate and comprehensive data about any type of book in real-time, minimizing the amount of time and effort required.

1.2 Goals and Objectives

1. Obtaining each user's credentials before accessing the application which would log in from an employee.
2. Encrypting passwords before storing them in the database to ensure that they are saved safely.
3. Creating an efficient database to save storage waste and maintain data stability.
4. Creating a validation mechanism to save only authentic data to prevent the system from crashing.
5. There would be a sign-up screen where after validation the manager could create a new account for the employee.
6. There would be a home screen with all book information displayed, as well as a search bar on top where a user could search for what they needed.
7. The search bar would have a filter option where a user could arrange things according to their needs, and everything would be displayed in a card view style.
8. There would be a menu with extra options such as borrowing, returning, adding a new book, adding a new reader, inventory status, and persons in the library.
9. To add a new reader to the system, complete information would be collected in exchange for a fee.
10. There would be a page where all users with the book details would be displayed who would not return their books on time and would add some fines associated with their reader ID.
11. The current inventory status page would display all the low goods in the library to keep track of stock.
12. People in the library option would enter the information into the system with a timestamp for each user who entered the library.
13. All information about books, including the number of books on hand, their location in the library, the names and authors of the books, and the year the book was released, will be displayed on the home screen.
14. There would be a sign-out option in the menu to keep the machine in safe hands.
